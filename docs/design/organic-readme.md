# Organic design system

Organic is warm, rounded and a little playful: a cream-and-sand ground with a terracotta accent and a sage second accent, Caprasimo display headings over Figtree, 16px radii that grow into pills and soft circular shapes. Photographs are washed so they sit back into the warm page instead of on top of it.

## How to use this

- Link the one stylesheet from every page — `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` (adjust the relative path) — and take every color, font, spacing, radius and shadow from its variables (`var(--color-*)`, `var(--font-*)`, `var(--space-*)`, `var(--radius-*)`, `var(--shadow-*)`). Never hard-code a hex, a font name or a px value the tokens already carry.
- Build with the classes below rather than inventing parallel ones; the component pages are plain HTML, so view source and copy the markup.
- The whole system was derived from `theme.json`. To change the look, edit the tokens at the top of `styles.css` — every page, the thumbnail and this guide read from them.

## Direction

Left-aligned, asymmetric layouts. Flush-left headings; content hugs the left edge with whitespace on the right. Lean into round shapes — over-rounded containers, pill buttons (`border-radius: 999px`), soft circular accents.

## Color

A light ground (`--color-bg` #f5ead8) with `--color-text` #201e1d and two accents — `--color-accent` #c67139 and `--color-accent-2` #7a8a5e. Each role carries a 100–900 tonal ramp (`--color-neutral-100` … `--color-accent-2-900`) generated in OKLCH on a shared perceptual lightness scale, so the same step of any ramp has the same visual weight. Use the light steps (100–300) for tinted fills, hovers and subtle borders, 500 as the role's base, and the dark steps (700–900) for text on tinted fills and for pressed states; prefer ramp steps over ad-hoc `color-mix()`. For elevation use `--shadow-sm/md/lg` rather than ad-hoc box-shadows.

## Type

Caprasimo for headings over Figtree for body text, loaded as `--font-heading` / `--font-body`. Density 1.10× and radius 16px are already baked into the `--space-*` / `--radius-*` scales — use the variables, not raw numbers.

## Icons

Use Lucide icons (https://lucide.dev), at stroke-width 2.75 for a rounder, heavier look throughout.

## Interaction states

Interactive states are themed, never browser defaults: give every interactive element a `:hover` tint and a pressed state from the accent ramp (one step past the base — `--color-accent-600` on a light ground, or a `color-mix()` tint for outlined/ghost variants), and style keyboard focus with `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--color-accent); outline-offset: 2px; }` — never leave the default blue focus ring.

## Components

| Class                                                                                    | What it is                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.btn` with `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.btn-icon`, `.btn-block`    | Actions — the primary is a solid accent fill                              |
| `.tag` with `.tag-accent`, `.tag-accent-2`, `.tag-neutral`, `.tag-outline`               | Small labels tinted from the ramps                                        |
| `.seg` + `.seg-opt`                                                                      | Segmented control on native radio elements                                |
| `.card` with `.card-kicker`, `.card-title`, `.card-body`, `.card-meta`; `.elev-sm/md/lg` | Surface-filled content cards; elevation utilities                         |
| `.hr`                                                                                    | A horizontal rule — present, but this system prefers whitespace; avoid it |

States are built in: hovers and pressed states come from the accent ramp, keyboard focus is the 2px accent `:focus-visible` ring, `::selection` is an accent tint, and disabled controls drop to 45% opacity. The accent-to-ground pair is tuned to at least 3:1 — enough for icons, large text and interface chrome, not for body copy — so for paragraph-size text in the accent use a deep ramp step (`--color-accent-700` on this ground) rather than the accent itself.

## Do

- Over-round: `--radius-lg` for containers, `border-radius: 999px` for buttons and inputs.
- Use soft shapes — circles and blobs — as decoration.
- Reach for the sage `--color-accent-2-*` ramp as a genuine second voice, not just a highlight.

## Don't

- Do not draw sharp corners or hairline-only geometry.
- Do not desaturate the palette into greys — warmth is the point.
- Do not use condensed or geometric display faces; Caprasimo is the only display voice.
- Do not crowd elements; the rounded shapes need air to read as soft.
